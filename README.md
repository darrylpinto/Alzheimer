# alzheimer

Detection of Alzheimer's disease in MRI scans using image processing and machine learning models like Decision Tree and KNN.
Objective of this project was to compare how diffrent classification models perform on such a problem.

MATLAB was used for image-processing and Python for machine-learning packages.
